## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Low Traffic (SEO takes 3-6 months)
**Mitigation:**
- Start SEO immediately (can't wait)

- Guest post on established finance blogs (backlinks + exposure)
- Paid traffic test (small budget, $100-200 to validate conversion)

### Risk 2: Content Overwhelm (50 articles is a lot)
**Mitigation:**
- Hire freelance writer (Upwork, $0.05-0.10/word for finance content)
- Use AI to draft, human to refine/fact-check
- Repurpose content (one long article ‚Üí multiple shorter ones)
- Accept slower pace (30 articles by Month 6 still valuable)

### Risk 3: Tool Development Complexity
**Mitigation:**
- Start with simple MVP (basic screener, no fancy features)
- Use existing APIs (don't build from scratch)
- Consider no-code tools (Bubble, Webflow integrations)
- Focus on 1-2 tools done well vs. 5 half-finished

### Risk 4: Monetization Dependency (Affiliate links can change)
**Mitigation:**
- Diversify income streams (don't rely on one partner)
- Build email list (asset you own, not platform-dependent)
- Create evergreen affiliate content (not time-sensitive)
- Test multiple partners per category
