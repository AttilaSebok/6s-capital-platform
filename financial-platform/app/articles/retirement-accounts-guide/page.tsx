          Retirement accounts are the single most powerful wealth-building tool available to American investors. Understanding the differences between 401(k)s, Traditional IRAs, and Roth IRAs can save you hundreds of thousands in taxes over your lifetime.
        </p>

        <KeyTakeaway>
          The three main retirement accounts each offer different tax advantages: 401(k) provides employer matching and high contribution limits, Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now, and Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals. Most investors should use a combination of all three.

        <h2>Why Tax-Advantaged Accounts Matter</h2>

        <p>
          Retirement accounts supercharge your wealth through two powerful mechanisms: <strong>tax advantages</strong> and <strong>compound growth</strong>.
        </p>

        <ExampleBox title="The Tax Advantage in Numbers">
          <div className="space-y-4">
            <p className="font-semibold">$10,000 invested annually for 30 years at 8% return:</p>

            <div className="space-y-3 text-sm">
              <div className="p-3 bg-green-50 border border-green-200 rounded">

                <br />
                Taxes paid: $0 during growth (deferred until withdrawal)

        <h3>Additional Benefits</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Creditor protection:</strong> Retirement accounts are generally protected from lawsuits and bankruptcy</li>
          <li><strong>Forced discipline:</strong> Early withdrawal penalties encourage long-term saving</li>
          <li><strong>Employer contributions:</strong> 401(k) matching is free money that accelerates growth</li>
          <li><strong>Lower taxable income:</strong> Traditional contributions reduce your current tax bill</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="401k-explained">
        <h2>401(k): The Workplace Retirement Powerhouse</h2>

        <p>
          A 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that allows you to contribute pre-tax income directly from your paycheck. It's the foundation of most Americans' retirement savings.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>

        <div className="bg-stone-50 border border-stone-200 rounded-lg p-6 my-6">
          <ul className="space-y-3">
            <li>
              <strong>Contribution Limit (2025):</strong> $23,000 per year ($30,500 if age 50+)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tax Treatment:</strong> Pre-tax contributions (lowers current taxable income)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Employer Match:</strong> Many employers match 50-100% of your contributions up to 3-6% of salary
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Withdrawals:</strong> Taxed as ordinary income in retirement (age 59½+)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs):</strong> Must start withdrawals at age 73
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Investment Options:</strong> Limited to employer's plan offerings (usually mutual funds)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <KeyTakeaway>
          <strong>The Golden Rule:</strong> Always contribute enough to get the full employer match. If your employer matches 50% of the first 6% you contribute, that's an instant 50% return on your money—better than any investment.
        </KeyTakeaway>

        <ExampleBox title="Real Example: Employer Match Impact">
          <p>
            <strong>Scenario:</strong> You earn $80,000 annually. Your employer matches 100% of the first 3% you contribute.

          <ul className="mt-3 space-y-2 text-sm">
            <li>You contribute: 3% × $80,000 = $2,400/year</li>

            <li>Total annual contribution: $4,800</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-3 text-stone-700">
            <strong>Over 30 years at 8% return:</strong>
            <br />
            Your $2,400/year becomes $272,000
            <br />
            Employer's $2,400/year becomes $272,000
            <br />
            <strong>Total: $544,000</strong> (half was completely free)
          </p>
        </ExampleBox>

        <h3>Roth 401(k) Variant</h3>
        <p>
          Some employers offer a <strong>Roth 401(k)</strong> option. Unlike traditional 401(k):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contributions are after-tax (no immediate deduction)</li>
          <li>Withdrawals in retirement are completely tax-free</li>
          <li>Same contribution limits as traditional 401(k)</li>
          <li>Best for younger workers in lower tax brackets</li>
        </ul>

      <section id="traditional-ira">
        <h2>Traditional IRA: Individual Retirement Account</h2>

        <p>
          An IRA is a retirement account you open yourself (not through an employer). It offers similar tax benefits to a 401(k) but with more investment flexibility.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>

        <div className="bg-stone-50 border border-stone-200 rounded-lg p-6 my-6">

            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Who Should Use Traditional IRA?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>High earners today who expect lower income in retirement:</strong> Deduct at high tax rate now, pay taxes at lower rate later
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Self-employed individuals:</strong> Can contribute to both SEP-IRA ($69,000 limit) and Traditional IRA
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Those maximizing 401(k) who want additional tax-deferred space:</strong> After maxing 401(k), add IRA
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ExampleBox title="Tax Deduction Example">
          <p>
            <strong>Scenario:</strong> You're in the 24% tax bracket and contribute $7,000 to a Traditional IRA.

          <ul className="mt-3 space-y-2 text-sm">
            <li>Tax deduction: $7,000</li>

            <li>Effective cost: $5,320 (but $7,000 is working for you)</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-3 text-stone-700">
            You essentially invest $7,000 for only $5,320 out of pocket. The government subsidizes your retirement savings.

        <h2>Roth IRA: Tax-Free Growth Forever</h2>

        <p>
          The Roth IRA is the most powerful long-term wealth-building account available. You contribute after-tax dollars, but all growth and withdrawals are completely tax-free forever.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>

        <div className="bg-gold-50 border border-stone-200 rounded-lg p-6 my-6">

        <KeyTakeaway>
          <strong>The Roth IRA advantage grows exponentially over time.</strong> A $7,000 contribution at age 25 growing at 10% becomes $315,000 at age 65—completely tax-free. In a taxable account, you'd pay ~$62,000 in capital gains taxes (20% on $310,000 gain).
        </KeyTakeaway>

        <h3>Why Roth IRA is Powerful</h3>

        <ExampleBox title="Tax-Free Millionaire Math">
          <p className="font-semibold">Contributing $7,000/year from age 25 to 65 (40 years) at 10% return:</p>
          <ul className="mt-3 space-y-2 text-sm">
            <li>Total contributed: $280,000</li>
            <li>Total growth: $3,163,000</li>
            <li><strong>Final balance: $3,443,000</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Taxes owed in retirement: $0</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-3 text-stone-700 font-semibold">
            In a Traditional IRA, you'd owe ~$860,000 in taxes (25% bracket) when withdrawing. The Roth IRA saves you nearly $1 million in lifetime taxes.
          </p>
        </ExampleBox>

        <h3>Unique Roth IRA Benefits</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Withdraw contributions anytime:</strong> Contributed $20,000 over 3 years? Can withdraw that $20,000 penalty-free for emergencies
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>First-time home purchase:</strong> Can withdraw up to $10,000 earnings penalty-free
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No RMDs:</strong> Unlike Traditional IRA, never forced to withdraw—let it grow forever

            <strong>Estate planning:</strong> Pass tax-free wealth to heirs

        <h2>Traditional vs Roth: Which to Choose?</h2>

        <p>
          The eternal retirement planning question: pay taxes now (Roth) or later (Traditional)? The answer depends on your current vs. future tax rate.

        <p>
          Understanding withdrawal rules prevents costly mistakes. Early withdrawals can trigger 10% penalties plus income taxes.

            <li>
              <strong>Age 59½ and older:</strong> No penalty, just pay ordinary income tax

        <h2>Roth Conversion Strategies</h2>

        <p>
          A Roth conversion moves money from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. You pay taxes now on the converted amount, but all future growth is tax-free.
        </p>

        <h3>When Roth Conversions Make Sense</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Low-income years:</strong> Job loss, sabbatical, early retirement—convert while in lower tax bracket
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Market downturns:</strong> Convert when portfolio value is down (pay taxes on lower amount)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Before RMDs begin:</strong> Reduce future RMDs and associated taxes
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>High earners who can't contribute directly:</strong> "Backdoor Roth IRA" strategy
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Estate planning:</strong> Leave tax-free Roth assets to heirs
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Backdoor Roth IRA Strategy</h3>

        <ExampleBox title="Backdoor Roth for High Earners">
          <p>
            If your income exceeds Roth IRA limits ($165,000+ single), you can't contribute directly. Solution: the backdoor Roth.
          </p>

          <div className="mt-3 space-y-2 text-sm">
            <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Contribute $7,000 to Traditional IRA (non-deductible)</p>
            <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Immediately convert to Roth IRA</p>
            <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pay taxes only on gains (usually $0 if done immediately)</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> $7,000 in Roth IRA despite income limits</p>
          </div>

          <p className="mt-3 text-stone-700">
            <strong>Important:</strong> This only works cleanly if you have no other Traditional IRA balances (due to pro-rata rule). Consult a tax professional.
          </p>
        </ExampleBox>

        <h3>Roth Conversion Ladder Strategy</h3>

        <p>
          For early retirees, convert Traditional IRA funds to Roth gradually over several years to minimize taxes while staying in lower brackets.
        </p>

        <ExampleBox title="Conversion Ladder Example">
          <p>
            <strong>Scenario:</strong> Retire at 55 with $500,000 in Traditional IRA. Living expenses: $60,000/year.
          </p>

          <div className="mt-3 space-y-2 text-sm">
            <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Convert $40,000/year from Traditional to Roth (stay in 12% bracket)</p>
            <p>Taxes paid annually: ~$4,800</p>
            <p>After 5 years, Roth balance available for penalty-free withdrawal (5-year rule satisfied)</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Access retirement funds before 59½ without 10% penalty</p>
          </div>
        </ExampleBox>

        <KeyTakeaway>
          <strong>Roth conversions are irreversible</strong> (since 2018 tax law changes). Run the numbers carefully or consult a tax professional before converting large amounts.

          The first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily. Retirement accounts force this discipline through penalties, making them ideal for long-term wealth building.

        <p className="mt-6">
          Understanding retirement accounts transforms your financial future. A 25-year-old maxing out a Roth IRA can retire with over $3 million tax-free. A 35-year-old getting the full 401(k) match adds $500,000+ to retirement. Start today, contribute consistently, and let tax-advantaged compounding build your wealth.
