          Tax-loss harvesting is one of the most powerful yet underutilized tax strategies available to investors. By strategically selling losing investments to offset gains, you can save thousands in taxes annually while maintaining your investment strategy.
        </p>

        <KeyTakeaway>
          Tax-loss harvesting lets you sell investments at a loss to offset capital gains and deduct up to $3,000 annually against ordinary income. Losses you don't use this year carry forward indefinitely. A $100,000 portfolio harvesting $5,000 in losses saves $1,000-2,000 in taxes annually—compounded over decades, this adds hundreds of thousands to your wealth.

        <h2>How Tax-Loss Harvesting Works</h2>

        <p>
          Tax-loss harvesting is the practice of selling investments that have declined in value to realize a capital loss, which can offset capital gains and reduce your tax bill.

            <div>
              <strong>Step 1: Identify Losses</strong>

              <span className="text-xs text-stone-600">Use realized losses to offset capital gains from other investments (or deduct $3,000 against ordinary income)</span>

        <h2>The Wash-Sale Rule: The Most Important Rule</h2>

        <p>
          The wash-sale rule prevents you from claiming a tax loss if you buy the same or "substantially identical" security within 30 days before or after the sale.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-600 p-6 my-6">
          <h3 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-3">What Triggers a Wash Sale</h3>

          <div className="space-y-3 text-sm">
            <p>
              A wash sale occurs if you buy a "substantially identical" security within the <strong>61-day window</strong>: 30 days before the sale + day of sale + 30 days after = 61 days total.
            </p>

            <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded border border-red-200">
              <p className="font-semibold mb-2">Examples of Wash Sales (Disallowed):</p>

                <li>✗ Sell Apple stock for a loss, buy Apple stock again within 30 days</li>
                <li>✗ Sell Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), buy it back within 30 days</li>
                <li>✗ Sell Tesla in taxable account, buy Tesla in IRA within 30 days</li>
                <li>✗ Sell a stock, have your spouse buy the same stock within 30 days</li>
                <li>✗ Sell Microsoft, buy call options on Microsoft within 30 days</li>
              </ul>

              <ul className="text-xs space-y-2">
                <li>✓ Sell VOO (Vanguard S&P 500), immediately buy IVV (iShares S&P 500) - different issuers</li>
                <li>✓ Sell Apple, immediately buy Microsoft or tech sector ETF</li>
                <li>✓ Sell small-cap index, buy mid-cap index</li>
                <li>✓ Wait 31 days, then buy back the exact same security</li>
                <li>✓ Sell individual stock, buy sector ETF containing that stock (not substantially identical)</li>

          <div className="space-y-3 text-sm">
            <p><strong>Timeline:</strong></p>
            <ul className="text-xs ml-4 space-y-1">
              <li><strong>Jan 1:</strong> Buy 100 shares Apple at $180 = $18,000</li>
              <li><strong>Oct 15:</strong> Apple drops to $150. Sell all shares = $15,000 (realize $3,000 loss)</li>
              <li><strong>Nov 5:</strong> Apple rebounds to $160. You rebuy 100 shares = $16,000</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="mt-3 p-3 bg-red-50 border border-red-200 rounded text-xs">
              <strong>Result: Wash sale violation!</strong>
              <br />
              You bought substantially identical security (Apple) within 30 days after the sale (Oct 15 → Nov 5 = 21 days).
              <br />
              <strong>Tax consequence:</strong> The $3,000 loss is disallowed for this year. Instead, it's added to the cost basis of your new shares.
              <br />
              New cost basis: $16,000 + $3,000 disallowed loss = $19,000
            </p>

            <p className="mt-3 text-stone-700 text-xs">
              <strong>Solution:</strong> Instead of buying Apple back, buy Microsoft or tech ETF (XLK, VGT) on Nov 5. Maintain tech exposure without triggering wash sale. Buy Apple back after 31 days (Nov 15+) if desired.
            </p>
          </div>
        </ExampleBox>

        <KeyTakeaway>
          <strong>Wash sale golden rule:</strong> Wait 31 calendar days before buying back the identical security. Or swap to a similar-but-different investment immediately (VOO → IVV, Apple → Microsoft, individual stock → sector ETF).

          <h3 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-4">7 Costly Tax-Loss Harvesting Errors</h3>

          <div className="space-y-4 text-sm">
            <div>
              <strong>1. Violating the Wash-Sale Rule</strong>
              <p className="text-xs text-stone-700">
                Buying back the same security within 30 days. Solution: Use different ETF issuers (VOO → IVV) or wait 31 days.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <strong>2. Harvesting in Tax-Advantaged Accounts</strong>
              <p className="text-xs text-stone-700">
                IRAs and 401(k)s grow tax-deferred—losses provide zero benefit. Only harvest in taxable brokerage accounts.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <strong>3. Letting Tax Tail Wag Investment Dog</strong>
              <p className="text-xs text-stone-700">
                Don't sell a great long-term investment just to harvest a small loss. Only harvest if you're comfortable owning the replacement.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <strong>4. Ignoring Transaction Costs</strong>
              <p className="text-xs text-stone-700">
                Harvesting a $200 loss when trades cost $100 round-trip = net $50 tax benefit (not worth it). Use commission-free brokers.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <strong>5. Buying Back Too Soon</strong>
              <p className="text-xs text-stone-700">
                "Day 28... close enough to 31, right?" Wrong. IRS counts calendar days. Day 32 is the first safe day.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <strong>6. Forgetting About Dividends</strong>
              <p className="text-xs text-stone-700">
                Selling right before ex-dividend date means you miss the dividend. Check ex-dates before harvesting dividend stocks.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <strong>7. Not Tracking Across Accounts</strong>
              <p className="text-xs text-stone-700">
                Selling Apple in taxable account while simultaneously buying Apple in IRA = wash sale. Track all accounts (including spouse's).

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <Blockquote author="CPA Maxim">
          The wash-sale rule has no mercy. The IRS will disallow your loss even if you accidentally triggered it. When in doubt, use a different security or wait 31 days. A small delay is better than losing thousands in tax benefits.

        <KeyTakeaway>
          <strong>Start harvesting today.</strong> Even in a bull market, individual positions create harvesting opportunities. A $10,000 loss harvested now saves $2,000-3,000 in taxes. Do that annually for 30 years, and you've built an extra $150,000+ from losses that would have gone to waste.

        <p className="mt-6">
          Tax-loss harvesting is the closest thing to financial alchemy—turning losses into gold. Master the wash-sale rule, harvest opportunistically, and automate if possible. Your future tax-free self will thank you.
